e-book 前言
====
First of all, I find that many foreign language books do not have a good Chinese translation. Secondly, I am trying to read foreign books. I hope I can read, with my understanding, as well as part of the translation to share with everyone. And I also want to record my own reading notes. This is the meaning of my project warehouse.
I hope everyone can enjoy reading.

首先，我发现现在很多的外文书籍并没有比较好的中文译本。其次，我也正在尝试着阅读外文书籍。我希望可以把我读到的，带着我的理解，以及翻译过来的部分分享给大家，也算是写给自己的读书笔记。这就是我创建这个项目仓库的意义。
希望每一个人都可以喜欢上阅读
